# Gameplay
WarTales features an enormous number of indepdent gameplay systems that interact with one another to create several "emergent gameplay" mechanics. 
The main systems that the gameplay is composed of are outlined below.

## Troop
The Troop is comprised of the individual [Companions] that are currently being managed by the player. The troop is comprised of humans and animals, each of which play a different role in the troop. The troop requires [Food] every night along with [Wages] every few nights in order to stay [Happy]. There are several different types of Bonuses that can be gained from [Resting], [Camping Gear], and progression through the various [Paths] available.

## Knowledge
The Knowledge ability helps the player learn new blueprints, bonuses, and recipes from the Compendium. Knowledge is gained by discovering new locations, crafting new items, or consuming [a specific type of item]. Each Knowledge point allows the player to unlock one ability from the [Compendium].

## Scenario
The progress of the main story quests in a specific region is tracked with the Scenario meter. Scenario quests will show up on the [World Map] as purple. 

## Suspicion
A high Suspicion level will cause the player to be chased by guard patrols. Suspicion is increased by stealing or various quest events. The suspicion meter is broken up into 5 levels each increasing the intensity with which the guard will chase you. The suspicion meter will slowly deplete over the course of time and the rate at which this meter depletes can be increased in the [Knowledge] section of the [Compendium]

## Fatigue
The troop's Fatigue will indicate when it's necessary to set up camp and rest. Fatigue slowly depletes as the player explores the world and engages in combat. 

## Happiness
The troop's happiness level will fluctuate based on the food consumed, quest events, and companion events. A high happiness level will provide various bonuses, while a low happiness level will push the companions in your troop to leave. 

## Influence
Influence is used to recruit new Companions, control the [Attribute] progression of [Companions] while levelling up, and unlock certain options in quest events.

## Valour
Valour points are used in combat to utilize certain types of skills. Valour points can be replenished through resting and certain types of companion events. 

## Food
The troop requires food before each rest. It's necessary to consistently manage the amount of food available in order to be able to continue exploring without making your [Companions] unhappy. Food can be found or purchased throughout the world and subsequently cooked using the [Cooking Pot] for additional bonuses.  

## Krowns
Krowns are the basic currency of WarTales. The troop requires wages to be paid every 3 days. The acquisition of Krowns can be done in a variety of ways and is the most important resource in the game.
