# Equipment

Equipment provides [Armor], [Guard], [Skills], and bonuses to [Attributes] and represents one of the core progression mechanics of the game. Armor can be purchased from [Merchants], crafted at the [Workshop] or [Anvil], or looted from [Combat] encounters.

## Weapon
In Wartales, there are 6 types of weapons: [Swords], [Axes], [Maces], [Daggers], [Bows], and [Polearms] some of which have both One-Hand and Two-Handed variations. Each weapon type is tied directly to a class and cannot be worn by a companion of another class. The base damage of a weapon is generally tied to the primary stat associated with the weapon ([Strength], [Dexterity], etc.). Weapons also provide unique [Skills] which allows for more flexibility in build and playstyle.

Weapons can also be permanently upgraded using various [Oils] crafted at the [Apothecary Table].
