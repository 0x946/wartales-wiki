# Recruitment
Companions can be recruited in a variety of different ways throughout the game but as the number of companions in a troop increases, the amount of food consumed and wages paid increases as well. The cost of recruiting a companion differs depending on the type of companion and where they are being recruited from.

## Inn
Human companions can be recruited from each Inn using [Krowns] and [Influence]. Every few days the companions available will cycle.

## Prison
Human and animal companions can be recruited from the prison for [Krowns]. Prisoners recruited have lower wages but will be more likely to leave the troop.

## Capture
Human and animal companions can be captured during combat using [Chains] for humans or [Rope] for animals. Once an enemy falls below 50% health, an adjacent companion can attempt to knock them out and capture them while they are engaged.
