# Attributes
Attributes govern various aspects of each companion's performance in battle and resource expenditure in the world. They are increased using Aptitude Points which are gained each time a comapnion levels up and through various interactions in the game world. By default, a random subset of attributes are available to upgraded by 1 or 2 points each time an Aptitude Point is used. The [Career Path](../compendium/knowledge.md) Knowledge can be used to spend [Influence](../gameplay.md#influence) to allow any attribute to be increased by 1 for 10 [Influence](../gameplay.md#influence) or 2 for 40 [Influence](../gameplay.md#influence) points.
