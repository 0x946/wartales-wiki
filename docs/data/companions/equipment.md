# Equipment

Equipment can be worn by companions and provides [Armor], [Guard], [Skills], and bonuses to [Attributes]. Acquiring Equipment represents one of the core progression mechanics of the game. [Armor] can be purchased from [Merchants], crafted at the [Workshop] or [Anvil], or looted from [Combat] encounters.

## Main Hand Slot
In Wartales, there are 6 types of weapons: [Swords], [Axes], [Maces], [Daggers], [Bows], and [Polearms] some of which have both One-Hand and Two-Handed variations. Each weapon type is tied directly to a class and cannot be worn by a companion of another class. The base damage of a weapon is generally tied to the primary attribute associated with the weapon ([Strength], [Dexterity], etc.). Weapons also provide unique [Skills] which allows for more flexibility in build and playstyle.

Weapons can also be permanently upgraded using various [Oils] crafted at the [Apothecary Table].

## Off-Hand Slot
[Shields] and [Off-Hand Weapons] can be equipped in the Off-Hand slot. The [Shields] provide additional [Armor], [Guard], and sometimes [Skills] or various defensive bonuses. The Off-Hand weapons generally have a finite number of uses and provide unique utility skills to any companion using one.

## Chest Armor Slot
Chest Armor is the main source of [Armor] and [Guard]. There are four variants, [Basic Armor], [Light Armor], [Medium Armor], and [Heavy Armor]. The type of chest armor that can be worn by a companion is determined by their unique class specialization. Some chest armor contains [Armour Layer] slots that provide additional bonuses. 

## Backpack Accessory
[Backpack Accessories] typically provide [Profession] related bonuses.

## Belt Accessory
[Belt Accessories] provide various combat and world map bonuses.
